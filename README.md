# CodeClan Data Ethics Presentation

In the third week of the CodeClan Data Analysis Course, we were given homework over a weekend to prepare a presentation on a topic of our choosing within the realm of data ethics. My topic was Deep Learning Transparency. I have included the slides and speaking notes that I created as PDF's. For an explanation of what people mean when they say "black box algorithms," I borrowed heavily from Dallas Card's article in Medium here: https://towardsdatascience.com/the-black-box-metaphor-in-machine-learning-4e57a3a1d2b0
